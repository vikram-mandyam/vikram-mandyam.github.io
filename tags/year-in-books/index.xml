This year I read 52 books (about 14,800 pages). Reading is like a marathon; maintaining a reading habit requires focus, effort, and endurance over time. Having a reading challenge like this helps make reading a daily habit and prevents compulsive social media consumption.

Through it all, reading has anchored me like nothing else.
