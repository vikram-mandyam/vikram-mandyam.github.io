It took me a little over a year to finish reading this end-to-end, but it has been well worth the time!
This is a very good book to get a clear picture of the landscape of data systems. It will provide you with enough details to figure out the right data approach for your project no matter what the scale of the project is.</description></item></channel></rss>
