It will provide you with enough details to figure out the right data approach for your project no matter what the scale of the project is.</description></item><item><title>My year 2019 in books</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2019/12/31/my-year-2019-in-books/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2019/12/31/my-year-2019-in-books/</guid><description>.org-center { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; } Photo by Iñaki del Olmo on Unsplash I’ve often felt that the dreaded drive to office is a massive waste of human potential.

While it is a business book, it has some relevant insights for the times we’re seeing now.
