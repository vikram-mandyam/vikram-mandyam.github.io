I use Org Mode for this as its markup syntax makes it easy and quick for capturing content.
Unfortunately, one has to also send over the minutes in an email to others and this involves a program other than Emacs most of the times. (those using mu4e or similar can consider themselves lucky!)
In such cases, I had to manually copy the contents of the org file to the external email client.</description></item></channel></rss>
