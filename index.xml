I&amp;rsquo;m Vikram. I have spent all of my professional life as a software developer &amp;amp; an architect. I get a kick out of designing and implementing cloud native scalable systems. My programming language toolkit includes Java, C#, C++, Ruby on Rails, Python, Common Lisp and Emacs Lisp.
I love tinkering my Emacs configuration and use Emacs for almost everything in my life, including writing on this blog.
I dabble in photography and have even been seen lying prostrate and contorting to get a good shot, according to the rumor mills.</description></item><item><title>Networks in Nature!</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2024/03/04/networks-in-nature/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2024/03/04/networks-in-nature/</guid><description>https://www.tumblr.com/visible-spectrum/743986878060101632</description></item><item><title>The books of the year 2023</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2024/02/03/the-books-of-the-year-2023/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2024/02/03/the-books-of-the-year-2023/</guid><description>I read 51 books in 2023. It was a good year of reading once again, and I say that with more gratitude than pride. I’ve been doing end-of-the-year book lists for 4 years now. You can read my previous lists here: 2022 , 2021 , 2020 , 2019 .
A lot of reading this year was fiction, and many of the philosophy and technical books were re-reads. Both of these genres have a lot of original books that are seminal and a lot of books that rehash and detail the same concepts.</description></item><item><title>Big Moon!</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2023/12/28/big-moon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2023/12/28/big-moon/</guid><description>https://visible-spectrum.tumblr.com/post/741316655719776256</description></item><item><title>Perspective!</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2023/07/03/perspective/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2023/07/03/perspective/</guid><description> All our biggest creations are small on a large enough scale!

I’ve been doing end-of-the-year book lists for 3 years now. You can read my previous lists here: 2021 , 2020 , 2019 .

We ruminate on the past, worry about the future or lament the present.
All of us search for those moments when we feel extremely peaceful and calm. This usually happens when we are at vacation, or just doing nothing. The reason we feel calm when we are at vacation is that there is nothing to immediately worry about and the mental chatter, occupies a pleasant space.</description></item><item><title>Learning is the constraint</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/04/05/learning-is-the-constraint/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/04/05/learning-is-the-constraint/</guid><description>TIL about &amp;ldquo;Learning is the constraint&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
In software teams, that need to deliver good results fast, every person in the team needs to learn fast and invest in learning to be a fast learner!
Quoting from the really insightful article :
&amp;ldquo;Think of a recent significant project or piece of work your team completed How long did it take, end to end, inception to delivery? Now imagine you were to do the same project over again, with the same team, the same organizational constraints, the same everything, except your team would already know everything they learned during the project.</description></item><item><title>Books I read in 2020</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/01/05/books-i-read-in-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/01/05/books-i-read-in-2020/</guid><description>.org-center { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; } Photo by Oladimeji Ajegbile from Pexel 2020 has been a tough year for everyone.

In such cases, I had to manually copy the contents of the org file to the external email client.</description></item><item><title>Nandi hills: A bench with no shade</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2019/12/31/nandi-hills-a-bench-with-no-shade/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2019/12/31/nandi-hills-a-bench-with-no-shade/</guid><description> A bench with no shade</description></item><item><title> "Designing data-intensive applications"​ By Martin Kleppmann: A summary</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2018/09/21/designing-data-intensive-applications-by-martin-kleppmann-a-summary/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2018/09/21/designing-data-intensive-applications-by-martin-kleppmann-a-summary/</guid><description>I recently finished reading the book &amp;ldquo;Designing data-intensive applications” , written by Martin Kleppmann .
