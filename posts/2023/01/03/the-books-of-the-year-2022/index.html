<p>2022 has been a year of ups and downs for the world at large, and it
has left me (and many others, I’d guess) with a looming sense of
unpredictability. Through it all, reading has anchored me like nothing
else.</p>
<p><em>I’ve been doing end-of-the-year book lists for 3 years now. You can
read my previous lists here: <a href=https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2022/01/02/the-books-of-the-year-2021/>2021</a>
, <a href=https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/01/05/books-i-read-in-2020/>2020</a>
, <a href=https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2019/12/31/my-year-2019-in-books/>2019</a>
.</em></p>
<p>Overall, I read <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/32018266 target=_blank rel=noopener>56 books this year</a>
, and here is a look at my favorite
of the lot</p>
<h3 id=a-short-history-of-nearly-everything-by-bill-bryson><em>A Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson</em></h3>
<style>.org-center{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center}</style>
<div class=org-center>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/bill_bryson_history.jpg height=500>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I have noticed this bestseller in innumerable stores, but this is the
year I finally got around to reading it. &ldquo;A Short History of Nearly
Everything&rdquo; is the quest of the author to understand everything that
has happened from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization. At 544
pages, it is truly an encyclopedia. The title feels clickbaity, but
the author backs it up, as he has done well to summarize the entire
history of our planet, universe, science, etc. into this one volume.
The thing that makes such books good is that the wonderment of the
author is so powerful, it percolates into you. How I wish our school
textbooks had been anywhere as good!</p>
<h3 id=developing-the-leader-within-you-2-dot-0-by-john-c-dot-maxwell><em>Developing the Leader Within You 2.0 by John C. Maxwell</em></h3>
<style>.org-center{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center}</style>
<div class=org-center>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/john_c_maxwell_leader.jpg height=500>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I listened to this book on audio and bookmarked almost all its
lines. This book has many interesting ideas, chief among them being
the five levels of leadership, the four dimensions of character,
etc. What struck me as refreshing is that there are no unnecessary
acronyms or examples.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Five Levels Of Leadership</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: POSITION</li>
<li>Level 2: PERMISSION</li>
<li>Level 3: PRODUCTION</li>
<li>Level 4: PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT</li>
<li>Level 5: PINNACLE</li>
</ul>
<p>‐ John C Maxwell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maxwell writes about Level 5 leaders as those who transcend
organizations, fields, countries, and even lifetimes/generations. For
example, Nelson Mandela was a Level 5 leader in government. Martin
Luther King Jr. was a Level 5 leader among social activists. Leonardo
da Vinci was a Level 5 leader in the arts and engineering. Aristotle
was a Level 5 leader in education and philosophy. This book can act
as a ready-reckoner for all of us when we are called upon to
lead. It’s so rich, you could pick any single chapter and read it as a
stand-alone!</p>
<h3 id=designing-event-driven-systems-by-ben-stopford><em>Designing Event-Driven Systems by Ben Stopford</em></h3>
<style>.org-center{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center}</style>
<div class=org-center>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/ben_stopford_event.jpg height=500>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This book is about stream processing using Kafka. Even if you are
interested in event-driven SOA-style architecture and not necessarily
stream processing, this book is worth a read. It has a good overview
of Kafka which helps in revising the concepts and can act as a
ready-reckoner. It also has a good treatment of event-driven systems
encouraging us to rethink the scale of architecture at a company level
as it needs to deal with consistency, concurrency, and evolution. The
patterns of streaming are good to know even for an SOA-style
architecture because few of them will help in avoiding pitfalls of
systems using events for collaboration. You will definitely learn
about safety, recoverability, gotchas of Kafka, and event-driven
approaches. Overall, a very good overview of designing event-driven
systems, which also delves into explaining the differences and
similarities between Event-Driven, Event-Sourced, Event-Stream, and
Stateful-Event-Stream.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Messaging helps us build loosely coupled services because it moves
pure data from a highly coupled place (the source) and puts it into a
loosely coupled place (the subscriber).</p>
<p>‐ Ben Stopford</p>

<h3 id=modern-wisdom-ancient-roots-the-movers-and-shakers-guide-to-unstoppable-success-by-srikumar-s-dot-rao><em>Modern Wisdom, Ancient Roots: The Movers and Shakers' Guide to Unstoppable Success by Srikumar S. Rao</em></h3>

<div class=org-center>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/srikumar_rao_modern_wisdom.jpg height=500>
</figure>
</div>
<p>A book by Srikumar Rao inevitably makes it into my year-end lists
every year. Like his earlier books, this one too distills eastern
philosophy effectively into byte-sized digestible chapters. Often,
success and tranquility do not come together. It is life&rsquo;s greatest
battle. This book helps you find that elusive balance.</p>
<h3 id=breath-the-new-science-of-a-lost-art-by-james-nestor><em>Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art by James Nestor</em></h3>
<style>.org-center{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center}</style>
<div class=org-center>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/james_nestor_breath.jpg height=500>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Using himself as a guinea pig, James Nestor goes deep into the world
of breathing to uncover some startling discoveries. In this book, he
nosedives (pun intended) into the history of breathing in various
cultures. Providing examples from ancient Hindu and Tibetan cultures,
he writes about the science of breathing and its impact on human
health. The author explains how humans shifted from the natural state
of nasal breathing to mouth breathing. The ill effects of chronic
mouth breathing were eye-opening to me. The overall message of the
book is that we need to breathe more slowly and through our noses, and
exhale longer than we inhale. This technique is beneficial for our
lungs and body, with many proven mental and physical benefits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Breathing techniques are best suited to serve as preventative
maintenance, a way to retain balance in the body so that milder
problems don’t blossom into more serious health issues. Should we lose
that balance from time to time, breathing can often bring it back.</p>
<p>‐ James Nestor</p>

<h2 id=and-dot-dot-dot-the-best-book-i-read-in-2022>And&mldr; The best book I read in 2022</h2>
<h3 id=the-egg-by-andy-weir><em>The Egg by Andy Weir</em></h3>
<style>.org-center{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center}</style>
<div class=org-center>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/andy_weir_egg.jpg height=500>
</figure>
</div>
<p>At 3 pages, this may not even qualify to be a book. But it was so
awesome that I added it to my list as the best book of 2022. In fact,
it may make my all-time list. Andy Weir, famously known for writing
the book &ldquo;Martian&rdquo;, blows your mind away with a simple story about a
nameless 48-year-old man who dies in an accident. Saying anything more
will not be fair to anyone who wants to read this book. It is more
than worth the few minutes it takes to read, and moreover it&rsquo;s
free. You can read it <a href=http://galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html target=_blank rel=noopener>here</a>
.</p>
<h2 id=in-closing>In closing</h2>
<p>I have fond memories of reading these books, and I hope something from
this list leads to a serendipitous find for you! Wishing you a
fun-filled new reading year!</p>
