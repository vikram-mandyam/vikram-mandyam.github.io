<p>For a while in the mid-2000s, due to the whole agile and XP movement, the
term &lsquo;Architect&rsquo; was going out of fashion in the software industry. The
DevOps movement has allowed the role of a software architect to make a
comeback. The added velocity provided by DevOps, the humongous scale of data,
the added threat of security vulnerabilities - required a structured approach
to moving forward, thereby bringing back the &ldquo;Architect&rdquo; once again</p>

<p><a href=https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/The_Architect target=_blank rel=noopener>Photo from The Matrix Wiki</a>
</p>
</div>
<p>While there is tremendous interest in the technical side of the
architecture/software design, and how we can best use technology to solve the
problems, these technical aspects are just one part of the role of the
architect. It is not just about using the technology and architecting
software. It is about creating an architecture within a specific
organizational context, being cognizant of all that is happening around you,
within that context. This is necessary so that you can navigate and influence
that context when needed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;All architecture is dependent on the context&rdquo;</p>
<p>‐ <a href=https://www.amazon.in/Fundamentals-Software-Architecture-Engineering-Paperback/dp/9352139623/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Neal Ford, &ldquo;Fundamentals of Software Architecture&rdquo;</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore, architects must realize there are lesser-known skills that are
very important to being a well-rounded architect. There are very many books,
which delve deep into the role of an Architect, from a technology
perspective. I will not touch upon those here.</p>
<h2 id=why-is-the-role-of-a-software-architect-a-very-tough-role>Why is the role of a software architect a very tough role?</h2>
<h3 id=change>Change</h3>
<p>Software architecture is a constantly moving target. This is because of
the rapidly changing software development ecosystem. In any fast-moving
large-scale software ecosystem, apart from &ldquo;change being the only
constant&rdquo;, mistakes will undoubtedly happen and time/resources will never
be enough as there is always more work than you can accomplish.</p>
<h3 id=trade-offs>Trade-offs</h3>
<p>Everything in software architecture is a trade-off. Since everything is a
trade-off, knowing why a decision was made is way more important than how.
Without knowing the &ldquo;why&rdquo;, documenting, communicating, and ensuring
compliance on that decision is going to be very difficult.</p>
<h3 id=scrutiny>Scrutiny</h3>
<p>Architectural decision-making is the most important role of a software
architect. But, almost every decision an architect makes will be
challenged - by product owners, project managers, and business
stakeholders due to costs and/or effort involved and by other
architects/developers/peers who may think their approach is better.</p>
<h3 id=breadth-vs-depth>Breadth vs depth</h3>
<p>Architects need to have a wide breadth of technical knowledge while still
maintaining a certain level of technical depth.</p>
<h3 id=conway-s-law>Conway&rsquo;s law</h3>
<p>Architecture and org charts don&rsquo;t really mix well: most of the time org
charts are thrust upon an architect. Fighting <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law target=_blank rel=noopener>Conway&rsquo;s law</a>
is tougher than
you think.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any organization that designs a system will produce a design whose structure is
a copy of the organization&rsquo;s communication structure.</p>
<p>‐  Melvin E. Conway</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id=hard-work>Hard work</h3>
<p>As per Physics, everything tends towards entropy, the more complex the
system the more the affinity to disorder. Software systems model complex
systems and this means one has to expend a tremendous amount of energy to
bring it within control. Architects must constantly spend energy.</p>
<h3 id=fear>Fear</h3>
<p>Eliminating the fear of changing a system due to its legacy nature is
extremely difficult. Many a time, The architect wants to change the system
to maintain agility in it. The org/team resists and pushes back. A system
that no one wants to touch has no agility at all. Getting the org onboard
is one of the toughest tight rope act in all the profession.</p>
<h2 id=the-lesser-known-skills-of-a-good-software-architect>The lesser known skills of a good software architect</h2>
<p>Now that, we know why the role is tough, let us look at how to deal with
them</p>
<h3 id=skill-the-art-of-asking-questions>Skill: The art of asking questions</h3>
<p>The architect should know how to ask a lot of questions - of the product
owners, of the project managers, and of the business stakeholders. What is
left unsaid by the stakeholders is often more important and the architect
needs to tease this out. In fact, the architect has to make the software
design by answering questions related to what, who, when, where, why, and
how</p>
<h3 id=skill-reversible-decisions-one-way-doors-and-two-way-doors>Skill: Reversible decisions, one-way doors and two-way doors</h3>
<p>Make all architecture decisions reversible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;One of an architect’s most important tasks is to eliminate
irreversibility in software designs&rdquo;</p>
<p>‐ Martin Fowler</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this is not possible, then use the famous decision-making framework from
<a href=https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-this-is-how-successful-people-make-such-smart-decisions.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Jeff Bezos</a>
. &ldquo;One-way door&rdquo; decisions are irreversible, whereas &ldquo;two-way
door&rdquo; decisions are reversible. Make &ldquo;two-way door&rdquo; decisions fast, but
&ldquo;one-way door&rdquo; extremely slowly and with consideration.</p>
<h3 id=skill-second-higher-order-thinking>Skill: Second/higher-order thinking</h3>
<p><a href=https://untools.co/second-order-thinking/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Higher-order thinking</a>
is most of the time linked to the long term and not
short term. Consider any decision you have to make, the effect it has
currently is the first order. The secondary effects that decisions will
have at a later point in time are very important for an architect to
consider. The secondary effects need not be related to technology only.</p>
<h3 id=skill-leadership>Skill: Leadership</h3>
<p>All effective software architects are good leaders, regardless of their
title. They lead by example and get people to follow along and do things
not based on their title as architects.</p>
<h3 id=skill-the-art-of-negotiation>Skill: The art of Negotiation</h3>
<p>All decisions need to be documented well, effectively communicated to the
right stake-holders. Providing the business value when justifying
decisions is vitally important for any architecture decision. The common
business justifications are &ldquo;time to market&rdquo;, user satisfaction, and
strategic positioning. When all else fails, state things in terms of cost
and effort needed, but only when all else fails. This is because, the
solution to the cost and effort problem is often adding more people to the
project! - which we know <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law target=_blank rel=noopener>doesn&rsquo;t work so well</a>
.</p>
<h3 id=skill-pragmatism>Skill: Pragmatism</h3>
<p>Good architects do not chase the newest shiny architectures just for the
sake of it. Architectural influences come and go. Effective architects
prioritize correctly, placing more emphasis on the right things, which
have greater business value and will be more enduring.</p>
<h3 id=skill-risk-assessment>Skill: Risk assessment</h3>
<p>Since the software ecosystem is constantly evolving, the architecture also
has to evolve accordingly and by continually analyzing risk, an architect
can correct defects within the architecture and take mitigating actions.</p>
<h3 id=skill-spend-time-learning-honing-skills>Skill: Spend time learning/honing skills</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four
sharpening the axe&rdquo;</p>
<p>‐ Abraham Lincoln.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As architects, always be sharpening the axe, If a task will take a week,
you are better off investing half a day or a full day in thinking it
through.</p>
<h3 id=skill-never-send-a-human-to-do-a-machine-s-job>Skill: Never send a human to do a machine&rsquo;s job</h3>
<p>The architect needs to know what to automate and needs to rely on good
devops practices that give the speed to delivery, which will be needed as
the system becomes more and more complex.</p>
