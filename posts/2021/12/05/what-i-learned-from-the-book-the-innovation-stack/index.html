<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2>
<p>I recently read a fascinating book by Jim McKelvey called &ldquo;The Innovation
Stack&rdquo;. It is about the origin story of &ldquo;Square&rdquo; - the &ldquo;payments startup&rdquo;.
Although this book is the story of Square, it is actually much more - part
philosophy, part biography, part business book.</p>
<p>Here is my summary of it.</p>
<h2 id=entrepreneurship-is-different-from-building-a-business>Entrepreneurship is different from building a business</h2>
<p>The author says building a traditional business is not entrepreneurship. He
talks of entrepreneurs as &ldquo;rebels&rdquo;, &ldquo;explorers&rdquo; and &ldquo;risk-takers&rdquo; who go
deep into uncharted territory - a concept he calls &ldquo;beyond the safety of the
walled city&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the major milestones of entrepreneurship is the moment when you say,
&ldquo;So that’s why no one’s done this before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Traditional businesses differ from the entrepreneurship world because the
formula for winning in existing markets is: Copy what everyone else does.</p>
<h2 id=what-exactly-are-innovation-stacks>What exactly are &ldquo;Innovation stacks&rdquo;?</h2>
<p>Having established this basic definition of an entrepreneur, it becomes easy
to define an innovation stack</p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, you usually begin the journey in an area where there is
no market. In this new market, you will have to try something truly new.
This will inevitably force you to solve a series of problems and the
solution to one problem leads to another problem or many problems. This
&ldquo;problem-solution-problems&rdquo; cycle continues on and in the end, you will have
a series of independent and interlocking inventions, which is an Innovation
Stack. Or you will have failed.</p>
<p>For this reason, you cannot conceive or build an innovation stack, it has to
evolve as you dive deeper into the problem space. Combining this Innovation
Stack with your advantage of being the first-mover creates a world-changing
solution.</p>
<p>Typically, Innovation Stacks tend to evolve unseen, hidden within small
companies that someday become giants.</p>
<h2 id=how-to-come-up-with-your-own-innovation-stack>How to come up with your own &ldquo;Innovation stack&rdquo;?</h2>
<h3 id=problem-selection>Problem selection</h3>
<p>Coming up with an Innovation Stack begins by choosing to solve a problem
that nobody has solved before. In fact you should choose a problem where
invention is the only solution.</p>
<p>This is easier said than done; it is more of an art and needs to be
combined with your own life&rsquo;s lessons. Much of how to do this cannot be
taught beyond saying you would do well to remember the Serenity prayer at
this point in time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to
change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference&mldr;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the &ldquo;Wisdom to know the difference&rdquo; only comes from repeated
failures.</p>
<h3 id=understanding-the-market-vs-expanding-the-market>Understanding the market vs expanding the market</h3>
<p>Life is easier when you serve the upper parts of the market, which are
already established. As you seek your problem space, at some point, the
market just ends. This is also the point where entrepreneurship begins and
is the prime real-estate for the innovation stack to germinate.</p>
<h3 id=experimentation-innovation-and-control>Experimentation, Innovation, and control</h3>
<p>As an entrepreneur, you must be willing to do what is right for the
product, even if the broader industry is not ready for it yet. This means
that it is important to control every aspect of your product.</p>
<p>It is not easy, however, as the early days call for rapid experimentation
and innovation. Sometimes, You have to do only the absolute minimum amount
of invention that allows you to survive.</p>
<p>Sometimes this means doing seemingly impossible things.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Connecting our software with the financial system was like sewing Kevlar to
toilet paper</p>
<p>‐ Jim McKelvey, The Innovation Stack</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, being forced to invent creates an environment where new ideas
could be born and evolve rapidly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Necessity mothers invention. You don’t plan to innovate, you don’t want to
innovate, you don’t aspire to innovate, you have to innovate. It begins by
putting yourself in a situation where innovation is the only alternative.</p>
<p>‐ Jim McKelvey, The Innovation Stack</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id=square-s-innovation-stack>Square’s Innovation Stack</h2>
<p>This is the most interesting part of the book, where you get to see the
innovation stack in action. Below is the list of innovations that are part
of Square&rsquo;s innovation stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplicity.</li>
<li>Free Sign-Up</li>
<li>Free is a magic price: you never have to explain free</li>
<li>Cheap Hardware</li>
<li>No Contracts</li>
<li>No Live Support.</li>
<li>Beautiful Software</li>
<li>Beautiful Hardware</li>
<li>Fast Settlement</li>
<li>Net Settlement</li>
<li>Low Price</li>
<li>No Advertising.</li>
<li>Online Sign-Up</li>
<li>New Fraud Modeling: fight fraud using data science and game theory.</li>
<li>Balance Sheet Accountability</li>
</ul>
<p>If we reword the above list as a paragraph instead of a series of unrelated
bullet points, we will see how this is actually a stack of innovations built
on top of one other:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want to allow millions of small businesses to accept credit cards for the
first time, so we have to make it easy to sign up. We need easy sign-up, so
we have to design simple software and eliminate paper contracts. We have
millions of people signing up, so we have to keep our customer service costs
down. We need to keep customer service costs down, so we have to have simple
pricing, and net settlements, and no hidden fees, and no paper contracts. We
need to have a low price, so we have to save money on advertising, so we
have to have an amazing product, and hardware so cool that people talk about
it, and a product that they can explain without our help.</p>
<p>‐ Jim McKelvey, The Innovation Stack</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The solution to one problem leads to another which leads to another until
eventually, you have the winning combination.</p>
<h3 id=how-does-the-innovation-stack-prevent-competition>How does the &ldquo;innovation stack&rdquo; prevent competition?</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing - every new company will eventually have fierce
competition from copy-cats, who will attempt to copy your innovation stack.
But this is easier said than done. The various blocks in the innovation
stack are tightly integrated. Each block only works in conjunction with all
the others. The entire Stack fails if one block is missing. The competition
would have to copy them all successfully in order to win. The math involved
in doing that gets very complicated.</p>
<p>Let’s say that a company has an 80 percent chance of copying any one of the
elements successfully. So, with one element, it’s at 80 percent. To get two
elements right, there is a 64 percent chance. And only a 51 percent chance
of copying three correctly and so on&mldr; You see where this is going. The
chances of copying all fourteen of these elements (0.8<sup>14</sup>) is about 4
percent.</p>
<p>So, the tougher the problem, the deeper the stack, which means the tougher
it is for the competition.</p>
<h2 id=quotable-quotes-and-witty-quips>Quotable quotes and witty quips</h2>
<p>This book would have felt like any other business book, except that it is
filled with so many quotes that make you go &ldquo;why hasn&rsquo;t anybody thought of
it like this before&rdquo; or &ldquo;why hasn&rsquo;t anybody said it like this before&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here are some that stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luck never feels like luck if you were working hard when you happened to get
lucky</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Caring about something is an audacious source of energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Change and innovation occur at constantly increasing rates. Once we become
used to a rate of change, we are already thinking too slowly.</p>

<p>The book is not just full of serious corporate verbiage, but also is very
funny at times. There are so many witty quips that make you want to clap,
laugh and salute the author at the same time.</p>
<p>Some noteworthy ones are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to ruin the leather seats on a corporate jet, just tell the
occupants that Amazon has decided to enter their market.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>History is basically selection bias in written form.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Right feels early. If the timing feels right, you are probably too late.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Copying is nature’s answer to entropy.</p>

<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I enjoyed reading this book. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if every founder
should write a book like this - filled with details that are not known to
the outsiders, with amazing insights, with brilliant ideas, and words from
the heart!</p>
