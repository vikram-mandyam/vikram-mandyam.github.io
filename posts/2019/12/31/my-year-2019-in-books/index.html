<p>I’ve often felt that the dreaded drive to office is a massive waste of human
potential. I am thankful for a job that allows me to carpool, so I can spend
this time reading. For me, the greatest joy in reading comes from a sensation of
time-dilation and flow.</p>
<h2 id=the-28-books-i-read-this-year>The 28 books I read this year</h2>
<p>This year has been a good one for my reading. I set my highest Goodreads target
yet, and beat it by making it to 28 (coincidentally, the atomic mass of silicon,
the element that shaped the industry I work in). Some of these books have truly
been life-changing — hence this blogpost.</p>
<p>The books that I read this year fell neatly into three categories — the
get-me-good-at-my-job variety, a ton of self-help literature, and some fun,
fast-paced fiction.</p>
<h3 id=get-me-good-at-my-job>Get-me-good-at-my-job</h3>
<h4 id=hackers-and-painters-by-paul-graham>Hackers & Painters by Paul Graham</h4>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/hckers-and-painters-paul-graham.png height=500>
</figure>
<p>The book explains to the layman what goes on in the universe of computers.
However, I think it is far more valuable for people within the universe of
computers. The author talks about the makers of society and how &ldquo;Hackers&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Painters&rdquo; are cut from the same cloth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the popular press, &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; means someone who breaks into computers. Among
programmers it means a good programmer. But the two meanings are connected. To
programmers, &ldquo;hacker&rdquo; connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone who
can make a computer do what he wants—whether the computer wants to or not.</p>
<p>‐ Paul Graham</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a great deal about the nature of code & complexity of software. The
author talks at length about LISP — the reason I read this book! In fact, all
through the book, the author’s respect for nerd in chief, a.k.a. alpha nerd
a.k.a. John McCarthy (creator of LISP programming language) is obvious. After
having gotten big-time into Emacs (former VIMmer here), I had my first taste of
LISP in the form of eLISP or emacs LISP. I believe every programmer should have
a work-language and a language that they loves to use when they moonlight as a
Hacker! For me, LISP is fast becoming this language.</p>
<h4 id=architecting-for-scale-by-lee-atchison>Architecting for Scale by Lee Atchison</h4>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/architecting-for-scale-lee-atchison.png height=500>
</figure>
<p>The author offers a fantastic explanation of availability from the perspective
of micro-services. The caveats around availability calculation make for some
&ldquo;aha&rdquo; moments. The risk management chapters are an exceptional read for any
manager — but they highlight the need for an engineer to wear the risk
management hat as well. This is because, as more complex software is built, a
lot of decisions made are nothing more than tradeoffs. The cloud services
chapters focused on AWS rather than Azure. Since my primary cloud of choice
these days is Azure, I skipped these chapters.</p>
<h4 id=numsense-data-science-for-the-layman-by-annalyn-ng>Numsense! Data science for the layman by Annalyn Ng</h4>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/numsense-data-science-for-layman.png height=500>
</figure>
<p>Data science is intimidating for anyone looking to get in. The math is scary and
the implementation is usually abstracted away in a black box. Which is why this
book is truly a gift. It shows you the data landscape very clearly while keeping
away from the swirling waves of details. Filled with a bunch of visuals, it is
easy to understand. But don&rsquo;t be misled by its simplicity — this book does not
water down any content. It still tells you everything you need to know!</p>
<h4 id=dot-dot-dot-and-the-rest>&mldr;and the rest!</h4>

<li>The Devops Handbook by Gene Kim</li>
<li>Devops Adoption Playbook by Sanjeev Sharma</li>
<li>Pro Power BI Architecture by Reza Rad</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone once told me that an engineer needs to be like a surfer, always riding
the highest wave — but also keep a lookout for the next highest wave, because
the current wave could die down anytime. I read the above books in an effort to
stay atop the wave in 2019!</p>
<h3 id=self-help>Self-help</h3>
<h4 id=happiness-at-work-by-srikumar-rao>Happiness at Work by Srikumar Rao</h4>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/happiness-at-work-srikumar-rao.png height=500>
</figure>
<p>I stumbled upon Dr. Srikumar Rao through some youtube videos of a talk he gave
at the Mindvalley institute. This led me to pick up his book and I loved it.
Cliche title aside, he explains interesting concepts such as mental
models/chatter, the theory of a benevolent universe, and investing in the
process rather than the outcome. It’s no wonder the subject he teaches at
university is the only one with an alumni association of its own!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you feel stuck in any part of your life? If it seems as if you are swimming
through molasses and nothing seems to be going right, then assuredly one or more
of your mental models are not serving you well. ‐ Dr. Srikumar Rao</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the link to the talk -</p>

<h4 id=losing-my-virginity-by-richard-branson>Losing my Virginity by Richard Branson</h4>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/losing-my-virginity-richard-branson.png height=500>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Screw it.</p>
<p>Let’s do it.</p>
<p>‐ Richard Branson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you read the autobiography of an entrepreneur of Richard&rsquo;s reputation, you
expect the book to teach you business. Instead, you get a business version of
the movie &ldquo;Point Break&rdquo; (the original one, the good one, the one with Keanu
Reeves).</p>
<p>This is a book that you should read to learn how to have fun while working hard.
I went in expecting entrepreneurial advice, but came out thinking — I need more
fun in my life.</p>
<h4 id=atomic-habits-by-james-clear>Atomic habits by James Clear</h4>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/atomix-habits-james-clear.png height=500>
</figure>
<p>The crux of this book is that the best way to form a habit is to make it part of
your identity. How do you do that? By starting small and staying consistent,
says the author. &ldquo;Read 30 books in a year&rdquo; should be brought down to &ldquo;Read 5
minutes every day&rdquo; and then increased to &ldquo;Read 30 pages a day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a world filled with airport-shelf-self-help books, whose content can be
expressed in a blog post, but is often expanded to 300 pages, this book by James
Clear stands out from the rest.</p>
<p>There are self-help books that make for a pleasant read. And then there are
those that have the potential to change to your life. I believe this one is one
of the latter. Apart from the book, I really like the &ldquo;3 ideas, 2 quotes, 1
question&rdquo; newsletter he sends out every Thursday.</p>

lesson I’ve distilled from many of these books is that I am not my thoughts.
That thoughts are bubbles that come and go, and that there is no need to react
to each thought. I was into meditation before, but these books have further
instilled in me the need to meditate, work out, eat healthy food and sleep well
every day.</p>

<p>In my hankering for pulp fiction, I stumble upon some interesting detective
novels once in a while. This one is a Sherlock Holmes novel, not written by Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle. Anthony Horowitz lives up to every Holmesian expectation —
which is already very high, thanks to the excellent Sherlock TV series, the
movies, and of course, Sir Doyle&rsquo;s canon work.</p>

<p>I’m new to psychological thrillers, and this book took me by surprise. The
mind-blowing twist in the end and the fast pace make for one very thrilling
read. It is the author’s debut novel and it has jumped straight to the top of
every list on Goodreads. The book of the year for me!</p>
<h4 id=dot-dot-dot-and-some-guilty-pleasures>&mldr;and some guilty pleasures</h4>
<ul>
<li>Black Site by Dalton Fury</li>
<li>The Afghan by Frederick Forsyth</li>
<li>The Debt Collector by Jon Mills</li>
<li>The Black Echo by Michael Connelly</li>
<li>The Protocol by J. Robert Kennedy</li>
<li>Brass Monkey by J. Robert Kennedy</li>
</ul>
<p>Something has gone gravely wrong — it has to be righted. It falls squarely upon
the protagonist, who has been betrayed, has undergone a lot of pain, has
sacrificed blood, sweat & tears, is broken down, but still comes back and kicks
a$$. You get the drift! I am a sucker for redemption-based action novels.</p>
<p>An honorary mention for the one book I wasn’t able to finish</p>
<ul>
<li>11/22/63 by Stephen King.</li>
</ul>
<p>I found this book voluminous and difficult to get through. I stopped reading
midway, but I haven’t given up. I think the habit of reading compounds. The more
you read, the more complex material you can read and comprehend. Someday soon, I
hope to be able to read books above my current reading level.</p>
