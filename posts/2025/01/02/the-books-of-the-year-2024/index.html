<p>I’ve been doing these end-of-the-year book lists for 5 years now. You
can read all my previous lists <a href=https://vikram-mandyam.com/tags/year-in-books/>here</a>
.</p>
<p>This year I read <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/12697080 target=_blank rel=noopener>52 books</a>
(about 14,800 pages). Reading is like a
marathon; maintaining a reading habit requires focus, effort, and
endurance over time. Having a reading challenge like this helps make
reading a daily habit and prevents compulsive social media
consumption.</p>
<p><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/2025-books.jpg alt=2025-books.jpg height=490>
#+end_center</p>
<p>Like in past years, this year too, I have tried to sample as many
genres as I can, but I primarily read
biographies/autobiographies/memoirs because they read like
fiction/stories and provide you with the learnings like non-fiction
books. Reading fiction feels like I am wasting time, but it is
enjoyable. Reading self-help books feels boring, because, oftentimes,
there is only one central message repeated too many times in the
book. (Auto)Biographies/memoirs fall in the sweet spot with good
stories and life lessons. When well written, they have an afterglow of
motivation in which you can bask for a while. Moreover, this &ldquo;book
high&rdquo; seems to last longer when the stories are personal and real.</p>
<h2 id=the-books-i-recommend>The books I recommend</h2>
<h3 id=a-shot-at-history-my-obsessive-journey-to-olympic-gold-by-abhinav-bindra-rohit-brijnath>A Shot At History: My Obsessive Journey to Olympic Gold by Abhinav Bindra, Rohit Brijnath</h3>
<style>.org-center{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center}</style>
<div class=org-center>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/a%20shot%20at%20history%20bindra.jpg height=300>
</figure>
</div>
<p>When athletes are on top, they make everything seem effortless. They
perform at their best almost in a meditative state. In this book,
Abhinav walks us through what it takes to develop such stillness and
fluency. It takes sheer obsession, working through pain - both
physical and mental - and developing a tolerance to it, to the point
that it feels like the athlete doesn&rsquo;t feel the pain. The descriptions
of the struggle and hard work in this book are very inspirational - I
listened to this book while running and broke a few of my personal
records.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Hitting the bullseye isn’t enough. We have to hit a particular part of
the bullseye&mldr;..
William Tell with his crossbow had to hit the apple,
Abhinav had to hit the seed inside the core of that apple. All the
time, every shot&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>－ Some of my fav quotes from this book</p>
<h3 id=not-too-late-the-power-of-pushing-limits-at-any-age-by-gwendolyn-bounds>Not Too Late: The Power of Pushing Limits at Any Age by Gwendolyn Bounds</h3>
<style>.org-center{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center}</style>
<div class=org-center>

</figure>
</div>
<p>As I crossed over to my 40s this year, I spent quite a lot of time
reflecting on what it means to get old. This book came in at a timely
moment for me. An account of how a middle-aged non-athletic person
went from a desk job to one of the top obstacle-course racers in the
world will surely kick anyone out of their middle-aged malaise. It
shows us that we all have the inner reserves necessary to push us
through any obstacle. Most ultra-endurance books are written by people
who do not have a family or a high-pressure job, and the race itself
is their first vocation. Not here, and this is what makes this book a
gripping read as the author also deals with life&rsquo;s normal demands. You
can push past your limits at any age, as long as you do not quit and
push past the blocks with deliberate practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s now, as the bright crescendo of our future and all its potential
dampens into that subdued hum of maintenance and managing deadlines
that we are in the most danger. In danger of no longer seeking new
passions. Of giving up on old ones. Of tipping into a belief state
that we are fully baked as humans. Of believing our bodies are too far
gone for any real redemption. Fully mired in the malaise of “this is
just how it is at this age”, we surrender. And so, the midlife
assassin declares victory, another victim claimed. “</p>
</blockquote>
<p>－ Gwendolyn Bounds, Not Too Late</p>
<h3 id=open-by-andre-agassi-j-dot-r-dot-moehringer>Open by Andre Agassi, J.R. Moehringer</h3>
<style>.org-center{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center}</style>
<div class=org-center>

</div>
<p>This could be one of the most entertaining autobiographies I have
read. It has one of the best opening chapters I have read.</p>
<p>This is exactly what one wants from an autobiography, a story of
honest struggle, a show of true personality, and a journey of
discovery. This book doesn&rsquo;t talk about how good Andre is at
tennis. Contrary to what many would think, Andre hates tennis, and
this book is about discovering what he wants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But I don’t feel that Wimbledon has changed me. I feel, in fact, as
if I’ve been let in on a dirty little secret: winning changes
nothing. Now that I’ve won a slam, I know something that very few
people on earth are permitted to know. A win doesn’t feel as good as a
loss feels bad, and the good feeling doesn’t last as long as the
bad. Not even close.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>－ Andre Agassi, Open</p>
<h2 id=in-closing>In closing</h2>
<p>At the end of this year, I asked myself: Why do I read? And why do I
post a list like this every year?</p>
<p>After much reflection, I feel it is not to show off or to feel good
having checked off an extrinsic goal of reading a certain number of
books every year.</p>
<p>I enjoy reading, and I want to continue to enjoy reading. In these
moments, it is best to think about <a href=https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2020/04/20/staying-in-the-game/>&ldquo;finite and infinite games&rdquo;</a>
. Finite
games have a clear, definite endpoint and a quantifiable outcome, but
infinite games don’t have an end and no clear definition of
“winning”. The point of infinite games is to keep playing for as long
as one can. It also makes one focus more on a &ldquo;qualitative&rdquo; goal over
a quantitative one.</p>
<p>If I choose a certain number of books as my goal, it becomes a finite
game. What&rsquo;s worse is, for any reason, If I do not hit that number, I
would lose the game. It is better to convert my goal into an infinite
game, by stating it as &ldquo;to keep on reading and learning to enjoy
reading stuff that I am interested in&rdquo;. With this north star set in
sight, having a reading challenge and a goal with a certain number of
books helps to make it a habit. Further, sharing posts like these
with the world simply acts as breadcrumbs, documenting my journey and
further gamifying the process.</p>
<p>In the end, Reading is no lesser than magic. As one popular meme said:</p>
