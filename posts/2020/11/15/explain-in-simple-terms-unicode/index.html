<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode target=_blank rel=noopener>Unicode</a>
is an important area that programmers needs to know, particularly if
one is doing some form of text processing and/or internationalization and
localization. Even if you are a seasoned coder, you may feel like you&rsquo;re on
thin ice with Unicode.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago, I tried to get to the bottom of Unicode, and I&rsquo;m writing this
article to document my understanding of it.</p>
<h2 id=common-terms>Common terms</h2>
<p>First, let us look at some terms which are commonly known, but may not be as
well understood.</p>
<h3 id=glyphs-and-fonts>Glyphs and Fonts</h3>
<p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font target=_blank rel=noopener>Fonts</a>
are a collection of patterns of ink on paper indicating how
characters of text will look like. The pattern of ink for a given character
in the set of characters is called a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph#Typography target=_blank rel=noopener>glyph</a>
. Depending on the font, multiple
glyphs can exist for the same character.</p>
<h3 id=character-set-and-character-encoding>Character set and character encoding</h3>
<p>Every character in a character set must be identified by the computer. For
this reason, every character has a code. American Standards Association
created <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII target=_blank rel=noopener>ASCII or American Standard Code for Information Interchange</a>
to
achieve this.</p>
<p>Not only does a computer need to know the code for a character, it also
needs to know how the code is to be represented. This is called <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding target=_blank rel=noopener>encoding</a>
.
For instance, in ASCII, the code for the lower case &lsquo;a&rsquo; is &lsquo;97&rsquo; which is
encoded as a single byte &lsquo;0x61&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 id=why-unicode>Why Unicode?</h2>
<p>Since ASCII uses a single byte to represent the code for a character, it is
not possible to support all the different characters that we have in all the
languages around the world.</p>
<p>For this reason, a better way was looked for, to codify characters and
represent them in encodings. Thus, Unicode was born.</p>
<p>In Unicode, code points are depicted as &ldquo;U+AAAA&rdquo;, where AAAA is a four digit
hexadecimal number. For code points beyond U+FFFF, which is the maximum, the
minimum number of digits needed to express the code point are used. For
example, the code point for the letter &ldquo;A&rdquo; of the Kharoshthi script is
expressed as U+10A00.</p>
<p>Note that the character representations by Unicode/ASCII specify characters
in an abstract way, without specifying how the characters are rendered on
screen. This is done by the rendering engine, based on information such as
font/glyphs, size, shape, color, style etc. Unicode is just used for
encoding.</p>
<p>Unicode was designed to be very compatible with ASCII, and so all ASCII code
points are the same in Unicode.</p>
<h2 id=lets-talk-about-unicode-and-its-encoding>Lets talk about Unicode and its encoding</h2>
<p>Next, we need to deal with how to store and transport these Unicode
representations on disk and over the wire. This is achieved with Unicode
encoding. Encoding defines how a Unicode is written in terms of raw bits.
There are a many types of encoding defined for storing Unicode data,
involving fixed and variable width.</p>
<p>A fixed-width encoding is one in which every code point is represented by a
fixed number of bytes, while a variable-length encoding is one in which
different characters can be represented by different numbers of bytes.
UTF-32 and UCS2 are fixed width, UTF-7 and UTF-8 are variable width, and
UTF-16 is a variable width encoding that looks deceptively similar to a
fixed width encoding.</p>
<h3 id=utf-8-encoding>UTF-8 Encoding</h3>
<p>UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit), a variable-length encoding, is
by far the most popular encoding. Compared to fixed-width encoding such as
UTF-16, UTF-8 saves a considerable amount of space for the same character.
It is also very flexible, as it supports encoding of a huge range of code
points. UTF-8 handles compatibility with ASCII by keeping all ASCII
encodings untouched, and using the higher order bits for higher code
points.</p>
<p>Since UTF-8 is a variable length encoding, it is necessary for it to encode
the length of the code point&rsquo;s representation in bytes into the first byte
of the encoding itself, and then use subsequent bytes to add the
representable bits.</p>
<p>In one byte of a UTF-8 character encoding, we will get between 0 and 7 bits
to the final code point. This reads like a long binary number from left to
right. The bits that make up the binary representation of each code point
are based on the bit masks shown below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Bytes</th>
<th>Bits</th>
<th>Byte Mask</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>7</td>
<td>0bbbbbbb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>11</td>
<td>110bbbbb 10bbbbbb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>16</td>
<td>1110bbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>21</td>
<td>11110bbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>26</td>
<td>111110bb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>31</td>
<td>1111110b 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>36</td>
<td>11111110 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td>
<td>42</td>
<td>11111111 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb 10bbbbbb</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In the above representation, &lsquo;1&rsquo;s and &lsquo;0&rsquo;s are fixed, while the &lsquo;b&rsquo;s are
the placeholders for bits from the Unicode&rsquo;s binary representation.</p>
<p>For e.g. let us look at the code point, U+041F, which is the capital letter
PE of the language Cyrillic. This is represented in binary as <code>100 0001 1111</code>, which is 11 bits in length. Using the above bit mask table, we can
use row 2. Replacing the &lsquo;b&rsquo; with the bits we get the final encoded value
as <code>0xd0 0x9</code>.</p>
<h3 id=byte-order-mark>Byte Order mark</h3>
<p>The big question that remains is how to determine if a given Unicode stream
is UTF-8 or UTF-16 i.e which encoding type is used. This is provided by
byte order mark. A byte order mark (BOM) is a sequence of bytes placed at
the beginning of a Unicode stream. Multibyte Unicode encodings such as
UTF-16 store the bytes that constitute a BOM code point in either order
(highest or lowest byte first), depending on the endianness of the system
(since systems can be big endian or little endian).</p>
<p>For a UTF-8 encoded stream, the BOM 0xEF,0xBB,0xBF is encoded in UTF-8 and
placed at the beginning of the stream. The actual output in bytes depends
on the encoding itself and the endianness, so after reading the first four
bytes of a Unicode stream, you can easily figure out the encoding type :</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Encoding</th>
<th>Byte Order Mask</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>UTF-16 big endian</td>
<td>0xfe 0xff</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UTF-16 little endian</td>
<td>0xff 0xfe</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UTF-32 big endian</td>
<td>0x00 0x00 0xfe 0xff</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UTF-32 little endian</td>
<td>0xff 0xfe 0x00 0x00</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UTF-8 little endian</td>
<td>0xef 0xbb 0xbf</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that UTF-8 has only little endian</p>
<h2 id=in-closing>In closing</h2>
<p>Since UTF-8 is the most commonly used encoding, I will stop here and let you
mull over what you&rsquo;ve just read..I hope I&rsquo;ve managed to simplify Unicode for
you!</p>
