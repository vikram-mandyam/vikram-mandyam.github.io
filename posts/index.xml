It took me a little over a year to finish reading this end-to-end, but it has been well worth the time!
This is a very good book to get a clear picture of the landscape of data systems. It will provide you with enough details to figure out the right data approach for your project no matter what the scale of the project is.</description></item><item><title>Nandi hills: A bench with no shade</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2019/12/31/nandi-hills-a-bench-with-no-shade/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2019/12/31/nandi-hills-a-bench-with-no-shade/</guid><description> A bench with no shade</description></item><item><title>Capturing and sending minutes of meeting in Emacs</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2019/02/25/capturing-and-sending-minutes-of-meeting-in-emacs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2019/02/25/capturing-and-sending-minutes-of-meeting-in-emacs/</guid><description>I use Emacs for everything, including writing minutes of any meeting I attend. I use Org Mode for this as its markup syntax makes it easy and quick for capturing content.
Unfortunately, one has to also send over the minutes in an email to others and this involves a program other than Emacs most of the times. (those using mu4e or similar can consider themselves lucky!)
In such cases, I had to manually copy the contents of the org file to the external email client.</description></item><item><title>My year 2019 in books</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2019/12/31/my-year-2019-in-books/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2019/12/31/my-year-2019-in-books/</guid><description>.org-center { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; } Photo by Iñaki del Olmo on Unsplash I’ve often felt that the dreaded drive to office is a massive waste of human potential. I am thankful for a job that allows me to carpool, so I can spend this time reading. For me, the greatest joy in reading comes from a sensation of time-dilation and flow.
The 28 books I read this year This year has been a good one for my reading.</description></item><item><title>Staying in the game</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2020/04/20/staying-in-the-game/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2020/04/20/staying-in-the-game/</guid><description>.org-center { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; } Photo by freddie marriage on Unsplash I recently read the book “The infinite game” by Simon Sinek . While it is a business book, it has some relevant insights for the times we’re seeing now.
Finite and infinite games The author talks about two types of games - finite games and infinite games. An example of a finite game is tennis.</description></item><item><title>Explain in simple terms: Unicode</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2020/11/15/explain-in-simple-terms-unicode/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2020/11/15/explain-in-simple-terms-unicode/</guid><description>Unicode is an important area that programmers needs to know, particularly if one is doing some form of text processing and/or internationalization and localization. Even if you are a seasoned coder, you may feel like you&amp;rsquo;re on thin ice with Unicode.
Some weeks ago, I tried to get to the bottom of Unicode, and I&amp;rsquo;m writing this article to document my understanding of it.
Common terms First, let us look at some terms which are commonly known, but may not be as well understood.</description></item><item><title>Books I read in 2020</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/01/05/books-i-read-in-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/01/05/books-i-read-in-2020/</guid><description>.org-center { margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center; } Photo by Oladimeji Ajegbile from Pexel 2020 has been a tough year for everyone. It has been said so many times that it has become a cliché. I only bring this up because the first book I read in 2020 was on an airplane - back when &amp;ldquo;travel&amp;rdquo; was not a dreaded word. It almost feels alien, like a world that only ever existed in a dream!</description></item><item><title>Learning is the constraint</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/04/05/learning-is-the-constraint/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/04/05/learning-is-the-constraint/</guid><description>TIL about &amp;ldquo;Learning is the constraint&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;
In software teams, that need to deliver good results fast, every person in the team needs to learn fast and invest in learning to be a fast learner!
Quoting from the really insightful article :
&amp;ldquo;Think of a recent significant project or piece of work your team completed How long did it take, end to end, inception to delivery? Now imagine you were to do the same project over again, with the same team, the same organizational constraints, the same everything, except your team would already know everything they learned during the project.</description></item><item><title>A Daily Pact With Philosophy</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/10/23/a-daily-pact-with-philosophy/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/10/23/a-daily-pact-with-philosophy/</guid><description>Almost everybody complains that life is too busy, stressful, meaningless, unsatisfactory etc&amp;hellip; The mental chatter in our heads affects how we think, feel and act and this chatter is usually negative. We ruminate on the past, worry about the future or lament the present.
All of us search for those moments when we feel extremely peaceful and calm. This usually happens when we are at vacation, or just doing nothing. The reason we feel calm when we are at vacation is that there is nothing to immediately worry about and the mental chatter, occupies a pleasant space.</description></item><item><title>The lesser-known skills of a Software Architect</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/10/25/the-lesser-known-skills-of-a-software-architect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/10/25/the-lesser-known-skills-of-a-software-architect/</guid><description>For a while in the mid-2000s, due to the whole agile and XP movement, the term &amp;lsquo;Architect&amp;rsquo; was going out of fashion in the software industry. The DevOps movement has allowed the role of a software architect to make a comeback. The added velocity provided by DevOps, the humongous scale of data, the added threat of security vulnerabilities - required a structured approach to moving forward, thereby bringing back the &amp;ldquo;Architect&amp;rdquo; once again</description></item><item><title>A Diya well lit</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/11/21/a-diya-well-lit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/11/21/a-diya-well-lit/</guid><description>https://visible-spectrum.tumblr.com/post/668434699848482816</description></item><item><title>Resilience</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/11/22/resilience/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/11/22/resilience/</guid><description>https://visible-spectrum.tumblr.com/post/668518472853159936/resilience Let this tiny delicate plant teach us about resilience: Almost eaten, growing amidst concrete and still fighting!

It is about the origin story of &amp;ldquo;Square&amp;rdquo; - the &amp;ldquo;payments startup&amp;rdquo;. Although this book is the story of Square, it is actually much more - part philosophy, part biography, part business book.
Here is my summary of it.</description></item><item><title>The books of the year 2021</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2022/01/02/the-books-of-the-year-2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2022/01/02/the-books-of-the-year-2021/</guid><description>It is that time of the year again when social media will be rife with lists-of-the-year posts. The lists could be about videos, podcasts, movies, etc. I’ve been doing end-of-the-year book lists for 2 years now. You can read my previous lists here: 2020 , 2019 . So I asked myself, Should I write one this year too? I realized the answer to that lay in the more intriguing question: Why am I doing this?</description></item><item><title>Sleeping Mutt</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2022/02/07/sleeping-mutt/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2022/02/07/sleeping-mutt/</guid><description>https://visible-spectrum.tumblr.com/post/675489545942351872</description></item><item><title>Bleak</title><link>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2022/03/29/bleak/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2022/03/29/bleak/</guid><description>https://visible-spectrum.tumblr.com/post/680033505938472960/bleak</description></item></channel></rss>
