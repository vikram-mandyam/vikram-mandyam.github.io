<p>I read <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/39762745 target=_blank rel=noopener>51 books</a>
in 2023. It was a good year of reading once again, and
I say that with more gratitude than pride. I’ve been doing
end-of-the-year book lists for 4 years now. You can read my previous
lists here: <a href=https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2023/01/03/the-books-of-the-year-2022/>2022</a>
, <a href=https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2022/01/02/the-books-of-the-year-2021/>2021</a>
, <a href=https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/01/05/books-i-read-in-2020/>2020</a>
, <a href=https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2019/12/31/my-year-2019-in-books/>2019</a>
.</p>
<p>A lot of reading this year was fiction, and many of the philosophy and
technical books were re-reads. Both of these genres have a lot of
original books that are seminal and a lot of books that rehash and
detail the same concepts. Hence, I feel the need to go back to the
originals again and again. The <a href=https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2021/01/05/books-i-read-in-2020/#the-upanishads-by-eknath-easwaran-michael-n-dot-nagler>Upanishads</a>
is something I might even
revisit every year. Martin Kleppmann&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=https://vikram-mandyam.com/posts/2018/09/21/designing-data-intensive-applications-by-martin-kleppmann-a-summary/>Designing data intensive
applications</a>
&rdquo; is one other.</p>
<p>This made it difficult to rank the books I read this year. Should I
list the same books as previous years? Or should I exclude them and
rate the others?</p>
<p>Eventually I decided to exclude my previous recommendations and make
new recommendations this year. Thus, I only have 4 books to recommend
this year.</p>
<h2 id=philosophy>Philosophy</h2>
<p>If we split hair, the below books will most likely fall under
self-help. But since they are rooted in philosophy, I will mention
them here.</p>
<h3 id=buddha-s-office-the-ancient-art-of-waking-up-while-working-well-by-dan-zigmond>Buddha&rsquo;s Office: The Ancient Art of Waking Up While Working Well By Dan Zigmond</h3>
<style>.org-center{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center}</style>
<div class=org-center>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/buddhas-office.jpeg height=300>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Have you ever wondered how The Buddha would have fared in the modern
office? Many a time, I have felt that philosophy books it is not very
practical and accessible. Not everyone can be an ascetic and live in a
forest renouncing everything. This is where this book comes in. It
shows you how you can practically apply any spiritual or philosophical
concept to the modern-day world. To be frank, Buddhism was taught by
The Buddha to the common person, and he made it very accessible. In
fact, he was the original listicle writer and gave us many lists such
as the four noble truths, the eight-fold path, five daily
remembrances, and many more.</p>
<p>I recommend this book only for this specific reason. You can subscribe
to any school of philosophy you want, you can always find a way to
make it practical and apply the learnings to your own life.</p>
<h3 id=chop-wood-carry-water-how-to-fall-in-love-with-the-process-of-becoming-great-joshua-medcalf>Chop Wood Carry Water: How to Fall In Love With the Process of Becoming Great Joshua Medcalf</h3>
<style>.org-center{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center}</style>
<div class=org-center>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/chop-wood-carry-water.jpeg height=300>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Continuing the theme from the previous book, This specific one helps
in applying ancient philosophy to the modern world. Set in a fictional
context in modern-day Japan, it showcases a Zen master and his
disciple who is trying to learn archery.</p>
<p>Almost always, good philosophy books are many generations old. The
onus is on you, the reader to make them relevant to the times you live
in. I believe that this is often why old books are discarded, and this
books helps in knowing how we can make some old teachings relevant
again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Old books can be made relevant. It is very easy to see that the
concept of &ldquo;the four noble truths&rdquo; from The Buddha is eternal. Marcus
Aurelius, who wrote Meditations, lived through a plague, very much
like we did during the Coronavirus pandemic of the 2020s. A Samurai
archer would prepare for his competition in the same way as a
modern-day Olympian/athlete would do.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id=fiction>Fiction</h2>
<p>This year, I switched to listening to fiction audiobooks in my car on
my commute to and from work. I always had issues with reading
non-fiction on audible, since it was very difficult to take
notes. Since I don&rsquo;t usually take notes when reading fiction, it
worked out perfectly. Going forward, I plan to switch to audiobooks
for fiction and other formats for non-fiction, allowing me to take
notes.</p>
<h3 id=the-accomplice-by-steve-cavanagh>The Accomplice by Steve Cavanagh</h3>
<style>.org-center{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center}</style>
<div class=org-center>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/accomplice-cavanagh.jpeg height=300>
</figure>
</div>
<p>I like legal thrillers and this is one of my favorite series in
addition to the Lincoln Lawyer series. If you enjoy a whodunit, with
thrilling courtroom battles, then this series is for you. The
protagonist, Eddie Flynn, the lawyer, needs to come up with winning
strategies against all odds while being under severe stress. The
author adeptly brings together a murder mystery, courtroom drama, and
gruesome serial killings together in this one.</p>
<h3 id=the-fix-by-david-baldacci>The Fix by David Baldacci</h3>
<style>.org-center{margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center}</style>
<div class=org-center>
<figure><img src=https://vikram-mandyam.com/ox-hugo/fix-baldacci.jpeg height=300>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This is yet another series I think I will finish. Amos Decker, the
protagonist, who has a photographic memory, witnesses a woman being
shot dead in broad daylight and then the killer shoots himself. I
liked how Amos Decker can make observations and deductions in this
story which was truly a page-turner for me.</p>
<hr>
<p>Although consistency is something I value, I tend to go
overboard. Many a time I burnt myself out by trying to cram too much
in. By the end of 2023, I wanted to sustainably pace myself, valuing
longevity as much as consistency, so I can do the thing I like longer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m indeed lucky that I get to read such great books. If anyone has
any great books to recommend, please send them my way.</p>
